# pomodoro

The pomodor technique is a time management method invented by [Francesco Cirillo](https://francescocirillo.com/) and it is simply explained:

1. Define the task you want to work on
2. Set a timer to 25 minutes
3. Work on the task focused
4. Stop work when the timer rings
5. Let x be the number of pomodoro done, then if
    - % 4 = 0 --> take a short 3-5 minute break
    - else    --> take a longer break of 15-30 minutes

You can practice this method with a mechanical timer, pen and paper and that would be totally fine. For me this was the best way to experiment with the method and to evaluate wether the method suits me. If you are 100% happy - stay with it and keep going.

If you want some more features and you find them in the follwoing list, give this pomodoro app a try.

- Digital Timer that gives a melodious or visual signal when 25 minutes are over
